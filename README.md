# Project-Nexus-AI
 unified, open-source platform for responsible AI development, combining data annotation, ethical evaluation, and generative AI.
Here is a concise summary and set of instructions for Project Nexus, suitable for your `README.md` file.

### üåü Project Nexus: A Responsible AI Framework

Project Nexus is an open-source framework designed to demonstrate and implement a full lifecycle for responsible AI development. It combines data preprocessing, ethical evaluation, and model explainability into a unified, easy-to-use pipeline. The project is built using interactive Python notebooks on Google Colab, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced practitioners to learn and apply key principles of fairness and transparency in machine learning.

### üöÄ How to Run the Notebooks

1.  **Clone the Repository:** First, clone the `Project-Nexus-AI` repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2.  **Open in Colab:** Navigate to the project's notebooks (`.ipynb` files). To get started, you can simply click the **"Open in Colab"** badge in the repository's main page.
3.  **Run in Order:** Execute the notebooks in the following order:
    * **`Nexus_Setup.ipynb`**: This notebook installs all the necessary libraries and dependencies. **Run this first.**
    * **`Nexus_Data_Preparation.ipynb`**: This notebook handles data loading, cleaning, and an interactive bias analysis.
    * **`Nexus_Ethical_Training.ipynb`**: This notebook trains the model, evaluates it for fairness, applies bias mitigation, and generates SHAP explanations.

### üìö Key Libraries Used

Project Nexus leverages the following open-source Python libraries:

* **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
* **`scikit-learn`**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
* **`fairlearn`**: A crucial toolkit for assessing and mitigating fairness issues in models.
* **`shap`**: For model explainability, providing insights into feature importance.
* **`transformers`**: From Hugging Face, used to demonstrate concepts of generative AI.
* **`ipywidgets`**: To create interactive components within the notebooks.
